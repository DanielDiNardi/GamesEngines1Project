## Description
For my Games Engines 1 project, I plan on creating an organism that can move, search, and interact with others of its species. The organism will live in a confined space that has everything it needs to live (water, food, and breeding mates). The organism will have a FOV so that it can search for the resources it needs to survive. Each organism will have a necessity bar that will influence its movement.

## Requirements
* Organism object.
* Limited world.
* Needs list.
* Randomised lerped movement.
* Organism FOV.
* Organism drinking, eating, and breeding mechanics.

## Tools
* Unity.
* Visual Studio Code.
* MagicaVoxel (Object 3D Modelling).
* SFXR (Sound Effects).
