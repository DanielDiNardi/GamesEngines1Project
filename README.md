# Games Engines 1 Project

## Description
For my Games Engines 1 project, I plan on creating an organism that can move, search, and interact with others of its species. The organism will live in a confined space that has everything it needs to live (water, food, and breeding mates). The organism will have a FOV so that it can search for the resources it needs to survive. Each organism will have a necessity bar that will influence its movement. The world in which the organisms will inhabit, will be procedurally generated. I plan on creating a limited 3x3 grid that will have randomly chosen tiles (acrisols soil and water) to create the flat terrain. Each grass tile will be further divided into a 3x3 grid that will have a chance of spawning one of three assets (preditor (yellow-throated marten), prey (long-tailed macaque), or fig trees that drop the fig fruit that the prey eats) per grid position.
